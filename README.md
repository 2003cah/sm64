## Oo! what's this branch?

The **Testbench** branch, ideally, is meant to just be a "whatever" kind of build. It's not meant to be a fully finished hack to any capacity, more to test what I can do with Decomp and to see if I like changes enough to put in actual hacks.

Currently in the testbench:
```diff
+ The Airhop, a pretty standard double jump that you can steer a little bit. Activated by pressing A in midair, with some exceptions
+ The Airdash, a forward zoom that you charge by holding the L button. The longer you charge, the longer and faster you fly!
- You get -50 lives and there's no HUD for it. This mostly prevents the chances of a game over, unless a really dedicated player wants to grab 50 lives. There's probably a better way to do this.
```
